    <h1 style="color:Tomato;">SMALL TOWN GIRL </h1>
    <h4>By Journey</h4>

  
<p style="color:rgba(114, 223, 104, 0.788);"></p>
 She's just a small town girl, living in a lonely world<br>
She took the midnight train going anywhere<br>
He's just a city boy, born and raised in South Detroit<br>
He took the midnight train going anywhere</p><br>

<p>
I seen her in a smoky room<br>
The smell of wine and cheap perfume<br>
For a smile they can share the night<br>
It goes on and on and on and on</p><br>

<p>
Strangers waiting, walking down the boulevard<br>
Their shadows searching in the night<br>
Street lights, people living just to find emotion<br>
Hiding somewhere in the night</p><br>

<p>
Working hard to get my fill, everybody wants a thrill<br>
Betting anything to roll the dice just one more time<br>
Some will win, some will lose, some are born to sing the blues<br>
And the movie never ends, it goes on and on and on and on</p><br>

<p>
Strangers waiting, walking down the boulevard<br>
Their shadows searching in the night<br>
Street lights, people, living just to find emotion<br>
Hiding somewhere in the night</p><br>

<p>
Don't stop believing, hold on to that feeling<br>
Street lights, people<br>
Don't stop believing, hold on<br>
Street lights, people</p><br>

<p>
Don't stop believing hold on to that feeling<br>
Street lights, people, ohh</p><br>
</br>
